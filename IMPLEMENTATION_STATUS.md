   - âœ… Report new problems
   - âœ… Resolve problems with actions (Dismissal, Re-training, Escalation)
   - âœ… Statistics endpoint
   - âœ… Automatic worker status updates

3. **EmployeeContractController** (`/workspace/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Employee/ContractController.php`)

### Frontend API Service:
- âœ… Added `employeeAPI` object to `/workspace/frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- âœ… All endpoints mapped with proper TypeScript structure

## ðŸš€ Next Steps - Frontend Implementation

### 1. Employee Portal Frontend Updates
Need to update these pages with CRUD functionality:

#### Workers.tsx

- Add Edit and Delete actions to worker cards
- Connect to `employeeAPI.createWorker`, `updateWorker`, `deleteWorker`

#### WorkerProblems.tsx
- Add "Report Problem" button and form
- Add resolution workflow for approved problems
- Connect to `employeeAPI.reportProblem`, `resolveProblem`

#### Contracts.tsx
- Add status update dropdown with confirmation
- Connect to `employeeAPI.updateContractStatus`

#### Reservations.tsx
- Add action buttons (Approve/Reject/Extend)
- Add confirmation dialogs
- Connect to `employeeAPI.processReservation`

#### Notifications.tsx
- Add mark as read functionality
- Add delete button
- Add "Mark all as read" button
- Connect to notification endpoints

### 2. Admin Portal - User Management
- Add create user modal to UsersPage.tsx
- Add delete confirmation dialog
- Use existing endpoints: `POST /admin/users`, `DELETE /admin/users/{id}`

### 3. Customer Portal - Payments & Invoices
- Connect PaymentPage to existing endpoints
- Add invoice download functionality using `GET /portal/contracts/{id}/invoice`

### 4. Agency Portal - Edit Proposal
- Implement full edit form in ProposalsPage
- Use existing endpoint: `PATCH /agency/proposals/{id}`
